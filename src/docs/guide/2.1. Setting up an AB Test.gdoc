This step assumes that you already have 2 variations of your pages that you wish to test. In Grails terms, these would be two separate actions or views. 

h3. Set up an experiment

* Login to your GWO account and select Experiments > Create another experiment
* Choose A/B Experiment - The simplest way to start testing fast
* Run through the checklist and click on "I've completed the steps above checkbox"
* Click on "Create"
* Fill in all the fields in the page 
* Click on "Continue"
* Select 'You will install and validate the JavaScript tags'

h3. Get your account and experiment ids.

At this point, you will see a few JavaScript tags that google requires you to embed on your site. 

The two bits of information you want is your account identifier and the experiment identifyer.

Under 2. Variation Pages, you will see a Tracking Script that looks like the following 

{code:javascript}
<!-- Google Website Optimizer Tracking Script -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  var _gaq = _gaq || [];
  _gaq.push(['gwo._setAccount', 'UA-25983867-2']);
  _gaq.push(['gwo._trackPageview', '/0156495775/test']);
  (function() {
    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
  })();
</script>
<!-- End of Google Website Optimizer Tracking Script -->
{code}

Your account identifier is the string set in this line:

{code}
  _gaq.push(['gwo._setAccount', 'UA-25983867-2']);
{code}

In this example, the account is 'UA-2598386702'

The experiment's id is the string set in this line:

{code}
  _gaq.push(['gwo._trackPageview', '/0156495775/test']);
{code}

In this example, your experiment id would be anything before /test, so for *0156495775*/test, the experiment id is 0156495775 

h3. Add your tags

On the control page, you want to add the following tag after the <head>

{code:xml}
<gwo:include control='true' account='UA-25983867-2' experiment='0156495775'/>
{code}

On your variation pages, you want to include the following tags:

{code:xml}
<gwo:include variation='true' account='UA-25983867-2' experiment='0156495775'/>
{code}

And on your conversion pages, you want the following:

{code:xml}
<gwo:conversion account='UA-25983867-2' experiment='0156495775'/>
{code}

h3. Validate your pages. 

At this point, your AB test is set and ready to track. You can validate your pages by saving a local copy of your application page's HTML source. 

Once your pages are validated, save your AB test and google website optimizer will begin serving alternatives whenever your visitors come to the original page.
